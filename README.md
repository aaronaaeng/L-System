# L-System
This program is a small project of mine.  One day I was bored in a lecture of mine so I decided to do research on the procedural generation of plants (I find that to be a very logical place to go).

It works as an application of Lindenmayer Systems.  It's a recursive method of representing the development of plants.  The recursion can begin on one of four preprogrammed starting axioms and rulesets.  The instructions are followed and these plants are then drawn using Python turtle graphics.
